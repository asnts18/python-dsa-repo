# python_dsa_repo

- This project serves as a collection of my solutions and code snippets for various data structures and algorithms problems, primarily from LeetCode. This repository also includes examples based on specific coding patterns, which are useful for mastering core concepts in algorithmic problem-solving.

- Solutions are categorized by problem type (e.g., arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming).

## Credits

- Portions of this project use code and learning materials from [Educative](https://www.educative.io/path/grokking-blind-75-in-python-mastery-through-coding-patterns), which helped in building a foundational understanding of patterns in data structure and algorithm problems.
